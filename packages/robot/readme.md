## Testing

Tests are located in the `test/` folder. Load `test/test.html` in your browser of choice with any HTTP server you like (I use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)). Tests are written in [QUnit](https://qunitjs.com/) and are simple to understand.

## Integrations

Robot works with a variety of UI libraries, and includes integrations for React, Preact, Haunted, and more. See the [integrations page](https://thisrobot.life/integrations.html) to learn more.
